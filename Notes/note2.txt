#Er Model:

    - it is an blue print in which the relationship bettwen the the two Entities


    - 
    Entities :
        -  is the word that dicribes like as follows
        - 1 student ,
        - 2 collage
        - 3 bank
        above are the Entities

    atributes :
        the word that dicribes the antities information
        like one Entities is student 
        and thier atributes are
            - 1 roolNo
            - 2 name 
            - 3 address
            - 4 school 
        like that above 


    - we can write the Entities in rectangular form 
    - we write  the atributes in the circular form 
    - we write the relationship bettwein two Entities in dimad form 

    
    eg:
    
    for example er model bettweint the cutomer and the bank as follows
        
        [cutomer]  -- <deposite> -- [amount]
        [cutomer]  -- <borrow>   -- [loan]
        [cutomer]  -- <open>   -- [account]

    like aboves 
    this is know as the ER model
